# RegReader
Read and search registry by write times

The repository only has two files:

  RegistryListing.exe
  registry_locations.txt
  
  The registry locations in the txt file will automatically be loaded into the combobox in the exe when opened.
  
  If you want to add additional registry locations, simply add them to the text file for use the next time the app is opened.
  
  The application will run search for registry keys, sub-key, value names, and values by date.
